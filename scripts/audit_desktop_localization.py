"""
Audit the generated desktop string table (`Localization.kt` + `Localization_<lang>.kt`).

Run from the repo root:  python3 scripts/audit_desktop_localization.py

Why this exists — `Localization.get` resolves a key in three steps:

    1. the language's own map;
    2. the English map;
    3. "the first map that has the key", as a last resort so a raw snake_case
       key never reaches the screen.

Step 3 is where a *translation* bug hides: if a key is missing from English but
present in some other language, an English build shows that other language. That
is how the Alpha lyrics style came out in Arabic letters, and how a key that only
the extras batches defined (never the Android resources) could show up in any
language but English. Both classes are reported here as errors.

The audit fails (exit 1) on

  * a key the UI asks for that no map defines (shows the raw key), and
  * a key missing from a language map, or present in one but absent from
    English (the step-3 leak).

It only *reports*, without failing, the two remaining "not translated yet"
classes, because they are the mobile resources' own gaps rather than a bug:

  * English text left in a language map (the resource was never translated
    upstream, or the key is desktop-only and no batch has covered it yet);
  * brand/technical strings that are meant to read the same everywhere.

`BRAND_KEYS` and `TECHNICAL_KEYS` below are that documented exception list.
