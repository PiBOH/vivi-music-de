/**
 * Desktop lyrics resolver.
 *
 * The mobile app asks a whole chain of lyric providers (community + official)
 * and picks the first one that answers; the desktop edition used to ask a
 * single community server (LrcLib) with no real duration, which produced
 * missing / wrong-version / un-synced lyrics and cached the mistake forever.
 *
 * This mirror of the mobile flow:
 *  - passes the REAL track duration (when known) to every provider so the
 *    correct recording is matched (± a few seconds), not just the same title;
 *  - falls back across providers in a fixed order until one answers (synced
 *    LRC preferred by each provider when it has one);
 *  - ends with the official YouTube Music lyrics for the exact video, so a
 *    track that no community server covers still shows its correct text;
 *  - logs which provider answered (and every failure) through [AppLog] so a
 *    bad case is diagnosable from an exported log.
