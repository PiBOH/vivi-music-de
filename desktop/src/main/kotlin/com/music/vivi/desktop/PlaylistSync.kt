/**
 * Keeps the desktop's playlists in step with the signed-in YouTube Music
 * account — the mobile app's *Auto sync with account*.
 *
 * The account's playlists are mirrored into [PlaylistStore] under a stable id
 * (`yt-<playlistId>`), so a second sync updates the same local playlist instead
 * of creating a duplicate. A mirrored playlist is only written when something
 * actually changed, so a sync that finds nothing new does not bump
 * `updatedAt` — that timestamp is the last-write-wins key of the device sync,
 * and bumping it for free would make an untouched playlist win against a
 * genuine edit made on the paired phone.
 *
 * Two directions, and the user asks for the second one explicitly: [sync] pulls
 * the account's playlists down, while [pushPlaylist] / [uploadMissing] create a
 * local playlist's copy **on the account** and upload its songs (the mobile
 * create dialog's *Sync playlist* switch, and the Account screen's
 * *Create on YouTube Music* action). A playlist that lives on both sides keeps
 * them together: a song added here is pushed ([songsAdded]), a rename is
 * propagated ([renamed]) and a deletion too ([deleted]) — the last one is
 * irreversible on the account, so it happens only from the delete the user
 * performs here, never from a tombstone that arrived over the device sync.
