/**
 * Small persistent cache for fetched lyrics, mirroring the audio file cache:
 * lyrics are kept in memory for the session and written to disk so they survive
 * restarts (matching the "stream cache forever" expectation). The Lyrics screen
 * reads/writes through here.
 *
 * The cache is keyed by BOTH the video id and the fetch mode ([preferSynced]):
 * a plain (non-timed) result produced by a "first answer wins" fetch must never
 * satisfy a later "synced lyrics" request (and vice versa), otherwise the
 * resolver fixes appear to do nothing because the stale entry is returned from
 * disk forever.

     * The file name carries BOTH a version suffix and the fetch mode
     * (`-s` = synced-first, `-p` = plain/first-answer), so:
     *  - entries written by an older resolver are ignored and re-fetched once;
     *  - toggling "Synced lyrics" never reuses the other mode's cached text.
     *
     * **Any change to how a provider is picked or validated MUST bump this
     * version.** A cached answer is served without asking any provider again, so
     * without a bump a wrong association survives the fix forever: the reported
     * `Blu Da Ba Dee` kept showing `Move Your Body - Eiffel 65` (the exact
     * mismatch fixed by the KuGou matching in 1.50.67) because that entry was
     * still on disk in `68ugkg9RePc.s.v4.txt`. v6 invalidates the answers of the
     * pre-Unicode-folding matcher (stylized titles could only match the wrong
     * song or nothing at all); v5 invalidated the wrong-song KuGou match; v4
     * separated the fetch modes; v3 invalidated first-answer-wins entries; v2
     * invalidated single-provider, no-duration lookups.
     *
     * **v7 — cached answers written before the styled renderer.** The animated
     * styles and the "nothing is sung here" break markers both read the
     * word-level timings *inside the cached text*, and a cached answer is served
     * without ever asking a provider again — so lyrics stored by an earlier
     * resolver keep rendering with the old text even after the renderer changed,
     * which is what "the style doesn't always load" looked like: same setting,
     * different result depending on whether the track had been played before.
     * v7 drops those entries and they are refetched once.
