/**
 * Self-contained AAC player: downloads the MP4 stream to a local cache file,
 * demuxes the (fragmented/DASH) MP4 container with `jcodec`, decodes the raw
 * AAC frames to PCM with the bundled `jaad` decoder, and plays them through
 * Java Sound. No native libraries or external binaries are required.
 *
 * Playback is **progressive**: the stream is downloaded to a unique `.part`
 * file in the background while the decoder starts as soon as the first audio
 * fragment is on disk, so a track begins in seconds instead of after the whole
 * file has downloaded. The sample table is grown incrementally as new `moof`
 * fragments arrive, and the download is shared between a look-ahead prefetch
 * and a user-initiated play of the same track.
 *
 * YouTube serves its `audio/mp4` streams as *fragmented* MP4 (fMP4, `ftyp`
 * brand "dash"): the `moov` sample table is empty and the real samples live in
 * `moof`/`trun` boxes, which `jaad`'s own `MP4Container` demuxer does not
 * understand. This player walks the `moof` fragments directly.
 *
 * Every failure stage reports a human-readable message through [onError]
 * instead of failing silently, so playback problems are visible in the UI.
