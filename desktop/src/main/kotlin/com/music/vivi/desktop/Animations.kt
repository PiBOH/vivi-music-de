 * touches the settings file: it is loaded once at startup and refreshed by the
 * settings screen when the user changes it. [ms] scales a base duration, [f] a

 *
 * [enabled] mirrors the master "Animations" switch: when it is off, the panel
 * and player transitions below become instant instead of being merely faster.
